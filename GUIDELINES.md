# Coding Guidelines for Rivant Media Developers

This document is is currently a work in progress, and presents practical
guidelines for developers and others at Rivant Media who write or contribute to
code or repo. The guidelines cover:

- the use of Git and GitHub in large and small projects,
- coding style and documentation, and
- code reviews.

This is a reference document, and as such you are expected to dip into
it to read the parts that you need to know something about.

- If you write code outside of the Rivant Media developers' team, you should read the full text of
  this document at least once, but there is no expectation that you will
  remember it all.
- If you are a member of the Rivant Media developers' team, you should
  make yourself familiar with these guidelines.
- In any case, these are _guidelines_, not hard rules. We do not force
  these guidelines on you or on ourselves. We do however think that they
  would help to streamline our workflow, improve teamwork and benefit both
  ourselves individually as well as the "products" that we produce as
  developers.

Remember, these guidelines are supposed to make everything we produce
better, so that we can say _"I was a part of that!"_.

## How to use Git and Github

This section contains instructions and requirements to contribute to any repository under Rivant's github organisation.

You should have git to use git commands. If not then download the [latest version of git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it in the system.
