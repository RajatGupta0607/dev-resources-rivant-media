# Coding Guidelines for Rivant Media Developers

This document is is currently a work in progress, and presents practical
guidelines for developers and others at Rivant Media who write or contribute to
code or repo. The guidelines cover:

- coding style and documentation,
- the use of Git and GitHub in large and small projects, and
- code reviews.

This is a reference document, and as such you are expected to dip into
it to read the parts that you need to know something about.
